# Cucumber Quick

Cucumber-Quick helps you to run cucumber scenario and features directly from vscode editor. You can simply right click on any feature file and choose the option from the context menu to run a specific scenario or the whole feature file.

## Installing locally
- To install, clone this repo into your /Users/[YOUR_USER]/.vscode/extensions directory
- Once you have the repo cloned into /.vscode/extensions, cd into the cucumber-quick folder, and run the following commands:
- `npm install`
- `npm run vscode:prepublish` 
- Now, in your UAT repo, add the settings.json file to the .vscode directory and add the following configuration information in there:
```ts
// .vscode > settings.json

{
  "cucumber-quick": {
		"tool": "webdriverio",
		"script": "npx wdio relative-path/to/wdio.conf.js"
	}
}

```
- Be sure to change the `script` command to point to the wdio.conf.js file in the appropriate tests folder for the test you want to run
- Once these commands run successfully, if you right click on a tag, you will see the option to "Run Cucumber Scenario with Tag"

## Supported Tools

Currently we support:

- Protractor Cucumber
- WebDriverIo Cucumber
- Cypress Cucumber Pre-processor
- Native CucumberJS
- Serenity-JS

## Setup Run Configuration

The extension needs to understand what tool you are using and what ae the different parameters specific to your test execution. Follow the steps below:

1. create settings.json file under .vscode folder (ignore if already created)
2. create cucumber-quick option for the specific tool you are using. The configuration structure is shown below:

```ts
// .vscode > settings.json

{
  "cucumber-quick": {
		"tool": "tool-name",
		"script": "npx tool-name relative-path/to/configurations"
	}
}


```

#### Protractor-Cucumber/ SerenityJS Configuration

```ts
// .vscode > settings.json

{
  "cucumber-quick": {
		"tool": "protractor",
		"script": "npx protractor relative-path/to/protractor.conf.js"
	}
}

```

#### WebDriverIO Configuration

- Make sure the WebDriverIO-cucumber setup uses wdio-test-runner, that means, it should have cucumberOpts enabled. Remember, the cucumber-boilerplate provided by WebDriverIO uses yadda as cucumber framework. In that case, this extension will not work. But once you switch to wdio-test-runner, this extension will work like magic!

- Find a video [here](https://github.com/abhinaba-ghosh/cucumber-quick/files/4728370/cucumber-quick.webm.zip) to get more about WDIO configuration

```ts
// .vscode > settings.json

{
  "cucumber-quick": {
		"tool": "webdriverio",
		"script": "npx wdio relative-path/to/wdio.conf.js"
	}
}

```

#### Cypress-Cucumber-Preprocessor Configuration

- Cypress cucumber preprocessor currently support ruining specific features. Running specific scenario by scenario name is still not supported by cypress-cucumber-preprocessor. It supports to run specific scenario by TAGS. You need to right-click on the Tags name in this case.

- Cucumber-Quick only support Cypress-Cucumber-Preprocessor V 2.1.0 or higher.

- For other tools, execution happens in VSCode Output terminal, but for Cypress, execution happens in Integrated terminal.

```ts
// .vscode > settings.json
{
	"cucumber-quick": {
		"tool": "cypress",
		"script": "npx cypress-tags"
	}
}


```

#### Native Cucumber-JS Configuration

> Note that: in scripts section, place the all features location as shown in the example configuration below:

```ts
// .vscode > settings.json

{
	"cucumber-quick": {
    "tool": "cucumberjs",
    "script": "npx cucumber-js relative-path/to/**/*.feature --require relative-path/to/**/*.js"
  }
}

```

## Run Scenarios and Features

- Navigate to a specific .feature file
- Right click on any scenario name/ scenario outline name
- You can choose two options from the context menu - _Run Cucumber Scenario_ and _Run Cucumber Feature_
- If _Run Scenario_ is selected, only that specific scenario will be executed
- If _Run Feature_ is selected, the complete feature file will be executed
- The test execution will be performed in debug mode, so if can debug certain codes using breakpoints as well.
